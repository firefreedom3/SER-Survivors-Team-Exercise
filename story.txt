A group of friends gathered at the Biergarten.
Und the beer, which does not grow as a root vegetable, was sooo good und foamy!
The men in the Biergarten were extremely Wettbewerbsfaehig, and challenged us to a drinking competition.
As the friends obliged, they figured that they were in for a long night of wettbewerbsfaehig drinking.
During the drinking competition, the scent of sizzling bratwurst filled the air.
You could hear the sound of a hund in the distance, as if it was cheering us on.
