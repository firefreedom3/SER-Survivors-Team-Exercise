A group of friends gathered at the Biergarten.
Und the beer, which does not grow as a root vegtable, was sooo good und foamy!
The men in the Biergarten were extremely Wettbewerbsfaehig, and challenged us to a drinking competition.
As the friends obliged, they figured that they were in for a long night of wettbewerbsfaehig drinking.
